# ListingPictures

One of the very first apps done by me to be more aware of the structure and syntax in Swift.

* Access to the File Manager and get images from imported file with a few images,
* Catching up with the UI and storyboards,
* Creation of TableView and its functionalities(delegate, datasource),
* Creation of the DetailViewController, so we can direct to another ViewController to perform the didSelect actions per each item from the TableView,
* NavigationController's usage - pushViewController vs presentViewController 
* Catching up with viewwillAppear, viewWillDisappear and their actions
* Some small addups in the design(UI)
